#
# About
#
#  This program demonstrates that the stack can be used to store integers.
#
# Usage:
#
#  $ go.vm run ./stack.in
#
# Or compile, then execute:
#
#  $ go.vm compile ./stack.in
#  $ go.vm execute ./stack.raw
#

        #
        # Store an integer, then push to the stack.
        #
        store #1, 2234
        push #1

        #
        # Store a different integer.
        #
        store #1, 65535

        #
        # POP from the stack - so we're back where we were.
        #
        pop #1

        #
        # Ensure we're _really_ there, because the expected value
        # has been returned.
        #
        cmp #1, 2234
        jmpz ok

        #
        # Boo - Failure.
        #
        store #0, "Error - stack push/pop mismatch\n"
        print_str #0
        exit

:ok
        #  Success.
        store #0, "Stack operation was successful\n"
        print_str #0
        exit
