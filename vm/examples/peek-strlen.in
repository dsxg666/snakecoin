#
# This example uses `peek` to read a string character by character
# and output the length of that string.
#
# Unfortunately we can't output the string itself as we have no
# "print character" option.
#
#

        #
        # #1 -> Address of string
        #
        # #0 -> Read each byte here
        #
        # #3 -> Length of string
        #

        store #3, 0x0000
        store #1, string
:loop
        peek #0, #1
        inc #1
        inc #3
        cmp #0, 0x00
        jmpnz loop

        # length will be one too many - so decrease by one
        dec #3

        store #1, "The length of the string is "
        print_str #1
        print_int #3
        store #1, " bytes\n"
        print_str #1
        exit

:string
        DB "Steve"
        DB 0x00
