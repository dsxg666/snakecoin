#
# About
#
#  This program only outputs some static strings and an integer
#
#  However it does prove that the goto/label handling is correct.
#
# Usage:
#
#  $ go.vm run ./jump.in
#
# Or compile, then execute:
#
#  $ go.vm compile ./jump.in
#  $ go.vm execute ./jump.raw
#

        store #1, "Steve Kemp\n"
        print_str #1
        jmp number

        # padding here - just for amusement.
        nop
        exit

:kirsi
        store #1, "Kirsi Kemp\n"
        print_str #1
        exit

:number
        store #1, 32
        print_int #1

        # add newline to the output
        store #1, "\n"
        print_str #1

        jmp kirsi
