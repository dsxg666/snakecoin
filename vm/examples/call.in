#
# About
#
#  This program demonstrates that we can use subroutines.
#
# Usage:
#
#  $ go.vm run ./call.in
#
# Or compile, then execute:
#
#  $ go.vm compile ./call.in
#  $ go.vm execute ./call.raw
#

        store #1, 15
        call print

        store #1, 240
        call print

        store #1, 255
        call print

        exit


#
#  This routine will print the integer stored in register #1
#
#  Then it will print a newline.
#
#  Then it will return to the caller.
#
:print
        print_int #1
        store #1, "\n"
        print_str #1
        ret
